    <div class="d6">
      As we head into the New Year, you might be interested in creating a budget
      <br />
      for yourself or you may be looking for a new tool to help manage your
      <br />
      startup or small business’s budget. You may be looking to switch out your
      <br />
      current budgeting app for a better one, or perhaps you’re someone who has
      <br />
      traditionally relied on spreadsheets. Although spreadsheets can be a
      <br />
      simple way to manage and track a budget, it could be worth checking out
      <br />
      budgeting apps to save yourself some time and effort. We’ve compiled two
      <br />
      lists of apps that we think are great budgeting tools for individuals and
      <br />
      startups.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      For individuals, a good budgeting app can help you save money by creating
      <br />
      and sticking to a monthly budget. For startups and small businesses, a
      <br />
      good budgeting app can help you understand your company’s financial health
      <br />
      and make informed decisions. Whichever way you go, the best budgeting app
      <br />
      for you will depend on your individual or business needs, so we’ve <br />
      included a variety of apps to help you find one that works best for you.
    </div>
    <div class="d1">Best apps for individuals</div>
    <div class="d2">Goodbudget</div>
    <img src="goodbudget1.png" alt="" class="d5" />
    <div class="d6">
      Goodbudget is a good app if you’re a beginner and just getting started out
      <br />
      with budgeting. It uses the envelope system, which is one of the original
      <br />
      ways of managing money. Goodbudget helps ensure that you are never caught
      <br />
      off-guard by a bill or sudden expense. Each month, you set aside money for
      <br />
      things that you need, like groceries and gas. Once you have set aside
      <br />
      money for your essentials, you can then choose how to use the rest based
      <br />
      on what’s important to you.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      The app is also a great option if you have a shared household, as it lets
      <br />
      you sync your budget with another person. Goodbudget offers both a free
      <br />
      version and a paid version, which costs $8 per month. The free version
      <br />
      includes everything you need to manage a budget, while the paid version
      <br />
      gives you additional capabilities, such as email support, unlimited <br />
      envelopes and the ability to use the service on five devices versus just
      <br />
      two. One possible downside is that you have to manually enter your <br />
      transactions in the app, as the app doesn’t connect to your bank account.
    </div>
    <div class="d2">PocketGuard</div>
    <img src="pocketguard1.webp" alt="" class="d5" />
    <div class="d6">
      If your main goal is to track your spending, PocketGuard might be the best
      <br />
      app for you. PocketGuard shows you how much spendable money you have after
      <br />
      you set aside enough for your bills, goals and necessities. The app shows
      <br />
      you a pie chart so you can visualize which expenses are taking up the most
      <br />
      money. You can set spending limits in the app to make sure you’re not
      <br />
      spending beyond your means.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      PocketGuard links your banks, credit cards, loans and investments in one
      <br />
      place in order to help you keep track of your account balances, net worth
      <br />
      and more. There’s a limited free version of the app and a paid version,
      <br />
      which costs $8 per month and unlocks features like the ability to create
      <br />
      your own spending categories, set a debt payoff plan, attach receipts,
      <br />
      export transaction data and more.
    </div>
    <div class="d2">HoneyDue</div>
    <img src="honeydue1.webp" alt="" class="d5" />
    <div class="d6">
      Honeydue is a good budgeting app if you want to plan and manage your
      <br />
      finances with your partner. The app syncs to yours and your partner’s bank
      <br />
      accounts. Honeydue lets you manage your money together while tracking your
      <br />
      expenses and communicating about bills. You can chat with your partner in
      <br />
      the app and decide whether one person will be covering a bill, or if the
      <br />
      two of you will be splitting it evenly.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      The app also offers its own joint bank account. Honeydue is free to use,
      <br />
      so it’s a good option for couples who don’t want to pay a monthly <br />
      subscription. One downside is that there isn’t a desktop version of the
      <br />
      app, so if you’re someone who likes to manage your finances on a bigger
      <br />
      screen, Honeydue might not be the best option for you.
    </div>
    <div class="d2">Empower</div>
    <img src="empower1.webp" alt="" class="d5" />
    <div class="d6">
      Empower is a good app if you want a tool for both budgeting and investing.
      <br />
      The app lets you track all your accounts, including your bank and credit
      <br />
      cards, IRAs, 401(k)s, mortgages and loans in one place. You can plan for
      <br />
      retirement, monitor your investments and uncover hidden fees. Empower
      <br />
      features a money-tracking dashboard that lets you track your expenses
      <br />
      based on categories.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      The service is free to use and is designed to help you manage both your
      <br />
      day-to-day finances while also helping plan for the future. However, if
      <br />
      your main goal is to budget your spending, Empower might not be the best
      <br />
      option for you. You may be better off choosing a different app on this
      <br />
      list because Empower’s budgeting tools aren’t as advanced as some of the
      <br />
      other ones.

    <div class="d1">Best apps for startups and small businesses</div>

      starting at $30 per month.
    </div>
    <div class="d2">Toshl</div>
    <img src="toshl1.webp" alt="" class="d5" />
    <div class="d6">
      If you want a reasonably priced and simple, but effective, budgeting tool,
      <br />
      Toshl may be the app for you. Although it’s marketed as a personal <br />
      budgeting app, Toshl can be a good tool for new startups looking to <br />
