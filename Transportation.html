    <div class="d6">
      Over here at TechCrunch, our time is often spent finding and reporting on
      <br />
      the next new new thing in mobility, from autonomous drones and electric
      <br />
      air taxis to self-driving trucks and even batteries made of paper. While
      <br />
      this tech, in theory, may someday help people and goods move from point A
      <br />
      to B, much of it is just that — theory. Hope. Promise. Showy demos to
      <br />
      impress VC investors.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      That’s why we dug into the technology that’s helping cities move today.
      <br />
      Some of it is unsexy, but transportation is, more often than not, a
      utility.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      We’ll take a close look at the tech helping move two U.S. cities — Miami
      <br />
      and New York City — and run through a few other standout innovations in
      2023.
    </div>
    <div class="d2">How Miami uses on-demand transit</div>
    <img src="miamitransit.jpg" alt="" class="d5"/>
    <div class="d6">
      Miami has been working with transit tech company Via to bring in on-demand
      <br />
      transit since 2020. The service, formerly called GO Connect, launched
      <br />
      during the COVID-19 pandemic as a first- and last-mile solution, filling
      <br />
      in the gaps between where people live and major transit hubs. Three years
      <br />
      later, Miami-Dade rebranded the service to MetroConnect, adopted it into
      <br />
      its broader public transit network and added four new service zones.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      Within a month of rebranding and expanding, MetroConnect completed 69%
      <br />
      more rides and saw a 70% increase in ridership, according to Via. The
      <br />
      company also said MetroConnect has, since its inception, increased access
      <br />
      to 57% more jobs within a 45-minute commute by connecting riders to <br />
      transit hubs, two-thirds of whom report that they do not have access to a
      car.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      Carlos Cruz-Casas, chief innovation officer at Miami’s department of
      <br />
      transportation and public works, told TechCrunch MetroConnect has helped
      <br />
      boost public transit ridership, which saw a drop during the COVID-19
      <br />
      pandemic.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      “There’s no substitute for well-run fixed-route service,” said Cruz-Casas.
      <br />
      “We actually realized that the best marketing tool for getting people back
      <br />
      on transit is frequency.”
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      While the city expanded MetroConnect’s on-demand microtransit, it also
      <br />
      worked with one of Via’s planning products to optimize its bus network.
      <br />
      The city used Remix, the transit planning tech that was acquired by Via in
      <br />
      2021, to build its Better Bus Network plan. The plan, which went live in
      <br />
      November, involved realigning 99 bus routes to create a network of <br />
      high-frequency corridors.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      “We went from five corridors that were frequent to more than 20 — for us
      <br />
      that means running every seven and a half minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes.
      <br />
      All day, everyday,” said Cruz-Casas. “Miami-Dade county is bigger than
      <br />
      some states, though. We can’t provide that frequency everywhere. That’s
      <br />
      where the on-demand transit comes in.”
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      Eventually, Via will add vehicles from May Mobility, a driverless <br />
      technology company, to its MetroConnect fleet in Miami. May Mobility and
      <br />
      Via recently announced a partnership to provide a rider-only on-demand
      <br />
      microtransit service in the retirement community of Sun City, Arizona.
      <br />
      May’s style has so far been to move carefully, so we don’t expect to see a
      <br />
      widespread Miami launch for some time.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      Cruz-Casas also noted that Miami is working with Via on a full intermodal
      <br />
      trip planning solution between fixed-route and on-demand services. Miami’s
      <br />
      transportation department has been partnering with a company called <br />
      Swiftly to provide big data analytics and more accurate real-time <br />
      information for its GO app
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      “I am a big fan of the technologies that allow for real-time feedback
      <br />
      because you feel empowered to make decisions and it’s a lot more <br />
      comfortable to use public transit when you have accurate real-time <br />
      information,” said Cruz-Casas.

    <div class="d2">Bringing NYC’s subway system to the 21st century</div>
    <img src="NYC Subway.webp" alt="" class="d5" />
    <div class="d6">
      New York City’s iconic subway system is more than 100 years old. Most of
      <br />
      the investment into the subway today is focused on modernization to help
      <br />
      the century-old system meet the needs and expectations of customers living
      <br />
      in an era of high technology.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      Part of that has been reducing the friction to ride. Anyone who’s ridden
      <br />
      the NYC subway will know that frustrating, and bizarrely nostalgic, <br />
      feeling of rushing to make your train, swiping your MetroCard and <br />
      barreling forward through the turnstiles in one motion, only to be bodily
      <br />
      met with an unmoving metal bar because you didn’t swipe correctly or, even
      <br />
      worse, have INSUFFICIENT FARE.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      The Metropolitan Transport Authority (MTA) is phasing out the MetroCard in
      <br />
      favor of the OMNY system, a contactless, open-loop payment system. Riders
      <br />
      can tap their credit and debit cards or their phones (if they have a
      <br />
      digital wallet) to quickly and easily pay the subway fare and move through
      <br />
      the turnstiles. For those who are unbanked and need to pay with cash, the
      <br />
      MTA is introducing an OMNY card, which can be accessed via vending <br />
      machines throughout the city.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      “We’re up to over 50% of subway riders and a significant percentage of bus
      <br />
      riders using tap-and-go one way or another,” Jamie Torres-Springer, <br />
      president of MTA construction and development, told TechCrunch. “And it’s
      <br />
      actually even better. Seventy percent of the riders who are currently
      <br />
      eligible to use OMNY are using it.”
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      During the COVID-19 pandemic, the MTA’s ridership fell to about 5%. Today,
      <br />
      the service is at around 80% of pre-COVID ridership, according to <br />
      Torres-Springer.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      “Very interestingly, as we’ve recovered ridership over the last year or
      <br />
      so, that entire recovery has been using OMNY, and MetroCard users have
      <br />
      been flat,” he said. “Which means that through the convenience, we are
      <br />
      attracting people back or attracting new riders to the system.”
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      The full phase-out of the MetroCard won’t happen until all MTA users can
      <br />
      easily access the OMNY payment platform.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      Another quintessential NYC subway experience is riding to work when <br />
      suddenly the train stops in a tunnel. And it doesn’t move. The conductor’s
      <br />
      voice crackles over the loudspeaker and you think you hear something about
      <br />
      a signal malfunction. You check your phone and have no reception. There
      <br />
      will be no texting your boss to let them know you’ll be late. All you can
      <br />
      do is pray for movement.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      The MTA is working on making experiences like that less common, and we’ll
      <br />
      get to that in a minute, but probably a nearer-term Band-Aid for such an
      <br />
      occasion is the agency’s plan to bring cell service to all subway stations
      <br />
      and tunnels. The city signed a deal in 2022 with Boldyn, formerly Transit
      <br />
      Wireless, to build out cell signal in all subway tunnels. Today, it’s in
      <br />
      stations citywide, which can carry you through to many of the tunnels as
      <br />
      long as they’re not of a significant length.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      Having service in the tunnels will be helpful for trip planning, and the
      <br />
      city is working to ensure better real-time information through <br />
      communication-based train control (CBTC). CBTC uses telecommunications
      <br />
      between the train and track equipment to manage traffic. “Now you always
      <br />
      know exactly where the trains are, and you can run them closer together
      <br />
      and faster,” said Torres-Springer, noting that the 7 line saw on-time
      <br />
      performance improve from 68% to 91%, and speeds increase from 8% to 14%,
      <br />
      after implementation of the technology.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      CBTC isn’t exactly new technology. It was initially adopted close to 30
      <br />
      years ago, but the MTA is ramping up installations. The agency is <br />
      investing $6.7 billion out of a total $55 billion five-year program into
      <br />
      CBTC improvements, and currently has five lines under construction, with
      <br />
      plans to do another two “substantial, long lines.” The MTA works with
      <br />
      telecommunications providers Siemens, Thales and Hitachi to make the
      <br />
      signals work.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      The city’s operating agencies are also working to implement predictive
      <br />
      maintenance for NYC’s subways, but Torres-Springer says that’s challenging
      <br />
      because there are more than 6 million separate assets within the system.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      “We’ve been around for 100 years. A lot of the information about the
      <br />
      assets is tucked into somebody’s notebook in a shop somewhere,” he said.
      <br />
      “First we got to get the inventory. Once we do that, we can really work
      <br />
      with predictive maintenance analytics tools.”
    </div>
    <div class="d2">Honorable mentions</div>
    <img src="honorable.webp" alt="" class="d5" />
    <div class="d6">
      A number of other companies, some of them working on frontier tech, also
      <br />
      helped people and packages move from point A to point B in 2023. Here are
      <br />
      some of the ones worth highlighting.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      Alphabet-owned autonomous vehicle company Waymo has made considerable
      <br />
      headway this year, notably in Phoenix. Waymo doubled its Waymo One service
      <br />
      area in May, connecting downtown Phoenix with East Valley and adding
      <br />
      Scottsdale. Waymo’s service area around the Phoenix area is now more than
      <br />
      225 square miles. And after initially launching autonomous airport rides
      <br />
      for members of the public in December 2022, Waymo this month launched
      <br />
      curbside pickup at the airport. In October, Waymo also teamed up with Uber
      <br />
      to launch its Waymo Driver in the ride-hailing app in Phoenix.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      Zooming out of the U.S., Israeli traffic management startup NoTraffic
      <br />
      worked with Nvidia and Rogers Communications to set up a 5G-connected
      <br />
      AI-enabled traffic management solution at the University of British <br />
      Columbia in 2023. NoTraffic, which raised $50 million earlier this year,
      <br />
      offers hardware and software that turns intersections into smart <br />
      intersections that can conduct traffic flows based on real-time data.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      UBC provided the perfect city microcosm to test out the effect of this
      <br />
      combined technical solution to traffic flows. The city campus not only
      <br />
      sees thousands of commuters everyday, but also plenty of pedestrians and
      <br />
      cyclists. NoTraffic says over the course of a year, wait times decreased
      <br />
      by a total of a thousand days for both cars and pedestrians. Carbon <br />
      emissions were estimated to have been cut by several tons, with economic
      <br />
      benefits exceeding $100,000.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      Meanwhile in the Netherlands, another Israeli startup — Moovit, a <br />
      trip-planning app — has partnered with Arriva, which operates train and
      <br />
      bus services in the country. Together, they launched glimble, a <br />
      Moovit-powered white label app that helps users plan, pay and ride with
      <br />
      any public transport operator, shared transit or micromobility provider
      <br />
      throughout the entire country.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      Through glimble, Moovit pulls together official information from all Dutch
      <br />
      transport agencies and crowdsourced information to calculate the best
      <br />
      route for each journey, with options for bus, rail, tram, underground,
      <br />
      ferry, taxi, Uber, car sharing, scooters and bikes. The app is also <br />
      available in 45 languages, which helps tourists and immigrants use it,
      <br />
      too.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      Around London, a startup called Route Reports is helping keep trains
      <br />
      running on time and safely by mapping the tracks. In autumn and winter,
      <br />
      leaves and ice on railways make the tracks slippery, so drivers proceed
      <br />
      with caution. That ends up causing delays and service cancellations, so
      <br />
      during those colder months, Transport for London ends up offering <br />
      less-frequent service, says Connell McLaughlin, CEO of Route Reports. In
      <br />
      the worst case, trains encountering unexpected conditions fail to stop,
      <br />
      and collide.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      Network Rail, the infrastructure manager of most of Great Britain’s rail
      <br />
      network, enlisted Route Reports to map slippery spots in real-time around
      <br />
      London, using data transmitted from passenger trains. Route Reports has
      <br />
      also fitted sensors to Network Rail’s special fleet of trains that use
      <br />
      high-pressure water jets to clean off leaf residue so the treatment can
      <br />
      also be tracked. McLaughlin says these interventions have reduced adhesion
      <br />
      reporting times from four hours to seconds.
    </div>
    <div class="d6">
      We’re looking forward to another year of technological progress in <br />
      mobility! May your 2024 be filled with on-time trains and buses, access to
      <br />
      first- and last-mile transport, dynamic traffic lights and more swift,
      <br />
      safe movement.
